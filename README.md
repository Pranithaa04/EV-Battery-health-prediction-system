**EV Battery Health Prediction Using Machine Learning**

This project aims to classify the health of Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries into three categories — Healthy, Degrading, and Critical — based on operational and environmental data using machine learning models. 
The best-performing model is deployed via a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

**Project Objectives**

1] Build a machine learning model to predict battery health using EV-related features.

2] Compare various classification algorithms and evaluate their performance.

3] Deploy the best model through a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard.

4] Provide actionable insights for preventive maintenance.
